# Exploratory Data Analysis

This is the third project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the [Data Analysis with R](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud651) course from Udacity.  In this project we investigate a dataset with the R programming language using exploratory data analysis techniques.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied.  EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover other questions, and eventually predictive models.  It is also an important “line of defense” against bad data and an opportunity to notice that assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.

The project was completed using R Markdown, and the final report can be viewed here:
