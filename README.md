# Data Analysis

This is the first project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud359) course from Udacity.  In this project we use data science techniques including data wrangling, applied statistics and machine learning, and effective visualization to answer questions and draw conclusions about subway and weather data for New York City.
